This repository provides a **summary and visual materials** of our work:  
**"Proactive Mission-Time-Efficient Coverage Path Planning Using Hierarchical Heuristics"**  
(*Under Review, 2025*)  

The proposed framework combines:  
- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** for coverage path generation  
- **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** for proactive charging scheduling  

By integrating charging decisions in advance, the method achieves up to **24.66% mission time reduction**, especially in sparse charging environments.

---

## ðŸš€ Key Contributions
- **Proactive Planning**: Plans charging stops before the battery reaches critical levels.  
- **Hierarchical Heuristic**: ACO ensures efficient path ordering, GA refines charging schedules.  
- **Efficiency Gains**: Demonstrated significant mission-time reduction in synthetic, real-world, and Antarctica-based environments.

## ðŸ“Š Results

### Simulation Comparisons
Comparison of four methods in a synthetic coverage environment:  
- **NCPP**: Ignores charging, fails due to battery depletion.  
- **ER**: Charges only when nearly depleted, leading to late detours.  
- **EVTSP**: Minimizes travel time but still charges reactively.  
- **GER (Proposed)**: Proactively schedules charging, avoiding long detours and reducing mission time.

### Battery Profiles
Battery level comparison under different methods and charging station densities.  
GER maintains safer margins by recharging earlier, avoiding critical depletion and reducing mission time.

### Mission Time Comparison
Total mission time (*T(Q\*)*) for NCPP, ER, EVTSP, and GER in a real-world-acquired environment.  
GER shows the shortest mission times across all charging station densities.
