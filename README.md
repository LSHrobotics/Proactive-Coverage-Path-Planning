This repository provides a **summary and visual materials** of our work:  
**"Proactive Mission-Time-Efficient Coverage Path Planning Using Hierarchical Heuristics"**  
(*Under Review, 2025*)  

The study proposes a **hierarchical heuristic framework** that combines:  
- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** for coverage path generation  
- **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** for proactive charging scheduling  

By integrating charging decisions in advance, the method reduces mission time by up to **24.66%**, particularly when charging stations are sparse.

## ðŸš€ Key Contributions
- **Proactive Planning**: Recharging is planned before the battery reaches critical levels.  
- **Hierarchical Heuristic**: ACO ensures efficient coverage ordering, GA optimizes charging stops.  
- **Improved Mission Efficiency**: Significant reduction in mission time across multiple environments (synthetic, real-world, Antarctica-inspired).
