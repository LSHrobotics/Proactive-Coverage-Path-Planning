*Figure 1. Flowchart of the proposed energy-aware CPP framework. The process begins with map generation and ACO-based path planning. Redundant nodes are then inserted to account for energy constraints, and a GA refines the solution by scheduling proactive recharging stops to minimize total mission time.*

This repository provides supplementary materials and visualizations for our study:  
**"Proactive Mission-Time-Efficient Coverage Path Planning Using Hierarchical Heuristics"**  
(*Under Review, 2025*)  

The proposed framework integrates:  
- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** for initial coverage path construction  
- **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** for proactive recharging optimization  

By embedding charging decisions into the planning stage, the method achieves up to **24.66% mission-time reduction**, particularly in sparse charging environments.

## ðŸš€ Key Contributions
- **Proactive Charging Strategy**: Incorporates recharge stops before the battery reaches critical levels.  
- **Hierarchical Heuristic Framework**: ACO ensures effective path ordering; GA optimizes the recharging schedule.  
- **Robust Efficiency Gains**: Validated across synthetic layouts, real-world-acquired environments, and an Antarctica-based case study.

*Figure 2. Reactive vs. proactive (GER) energy-aware planning. Black circles: coverage nodes (N); green circles: charging stations (C); dotted circles: sensing range (Rs). Unlike reactive methods that recharge only at low battery levels, GER proactively integrates recharging decisions into the coverage path.*

## ðŸ“Š Results

### ðŸ”¹ Simulation Comparisons
Evaluation of four methods in a synthetic coverage environment:  
- **NCPP**: No charging consideration, fails due to depletion.  
- **ER**: Reactive charging when nearly empty, causing detours.  
- **EVTSP**: Improves travel efficiency but still reactive in charging.  
- **GER (Proposed)**: Proactive charging integration, avoiding unnecessary detours and reducing mission time.

### ðŸ”¹ Battery Profiles
GER sustains safer energy margins by scheduling earlier recharges, avoiding critical depletion and reducing mission delays.

### ðŸ”¹ Mission Time Comparison
Total mission time (*T(Q\*)*) of NCPP, ER, EVTSP, and GER in real-world-acquired environments.  
GER consistently achieves the **lowest mission times across charging station densities**.

## ðŸŽ¥ Demo Video
For demonstration, the coverage mission time is accelerated by ~23Ã— to fit within one minute.  
In the paper, actual mission times align with **Table 4** results.
